# MaskMandator

## Hackerton submission for RPI 2020

## Inspiration
  Mask mandator is inspired by the fact that there are many people who do not follow the guidelines that are provided for the survival amid this era of global
  pandemic. Seeing those people without mask makes us feel quite uncomfortable, and, indeed, it is dangerous to let them intrude our peaceful lives. 

## What it does
  Using a webcam or camera installed, this website will take the given image and check if the person is properly wearing a mask, covering his or her nose as well.
  Reading the given QR code, it will provide an additional authentication of who the accessor is.

## How we built it
   We employed AI training model from Google API to perform the detection, IBM database as a storage, Flask and Firebase for integrated server, and python as a
   fundamental.

## Challenges we ran into
  - Manipulation of existing AI training models from Google API.
  - Integration between the frontend and the backend.
  - Translating the given AI into python code.

## What is next for MaskMandator
  - Enhance the precesion of detection. The current model we developed is unable to distinguish certain type of masks, including face-drawn mask.
