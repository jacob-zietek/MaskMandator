# MaskMandator

## Hackerton submission for RPI 2020

## Inspiration
  Mask mandator is inspired by the fact that there are many people who do not follow the guidelines that are provided for the survival amid this era of global
  pandemic. Seeing those people without mask makes us feel quite uncomfortable, and, indeed, it is dangerous to let them intrude our peaceful lives. 
  Profound desire of us to protect people and to look forward to the field of machine learning further inspired us to launch this project.

## What it does
  Using a webcam or camera installed, this website will take the given image and check if the person is properly wearing a mask, covering his or her nose as well.
  Reading the given QR code, it will provide an additional authentication of who the accessor is. At this moment, given QR code for each student will be compared to 
  the corresponding information at IBM database.

## How we built it
   We employed AI training model from Google API to perform the detection, IBM database as a storage for the information of students, Flask and Firebase for
   the integrated server, javascript and html for the website, and python as a fundamental.

## Challenges we ran into
  - Manipulation of existing AI training models from Google API.
  - Integration between the frontend and the backend.
  - Translating the given AI into python code.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of



## What we learned
**Arjun**:


**Bryan**:


**Jacob**:


**Jeongbin**: I have learned how the tensorflow models of IBM studio and Google API for image detection function, how to generate and detect given data from QR code based on python, and different ways to use Flask. 



## What is next for MaskMandator
  - Enhance the precesion of detection. The current model we developed is unable to distinguish certain types of masks, including face-drawn mask.
